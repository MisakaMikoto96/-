基于prolog以及凯尔特音乐grammar，生成凯尔特风格旋律。


Jig dance music, as a kind of genre of Celtic music, is a form of lively folk dance tune in compound metre full of Scottish and Irish flavors. The jig music field is very expandable with generally cheerful rhythm. After listening to traditional jig music, I make a new grammar(but with the same key and 6/8 time signature as most of jig musics are based on this time signature.)
Firstly, I change the structure of the rhythm to make more variation.(But based on the same time signature, the variations here are not very notable.)
Secondly, in addition to the given harmonies. I expend some additional harmonies (without Subtonic and Leading as I think that the frequencies of these two harmonies are less than others.)
Thirdly, in a particular harmony, I change the original three-note harmony to 4-note harmony by broader notion notes (as this kind of grammar system cannot support sharps and flats, I did not gain some chance to add more complicated harmonies.) Finally, in order to make more than one harmony per bar, I adjust the structure of rhythm variation and make consideration of the probability of transition from one harmony to another harmony and choose the suitable one in my mind.
